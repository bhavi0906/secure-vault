Explanation of the Schema
Database Creation (new_user):

This creates a database named new_user, which is referenced in your code during the connection (mysql_real_connect).
Table userx:

id: A unique, auto-incrementing identifier for each user.
name: Stores the full name of the user.
username: A unique username field.
password: A hashed password field stored as a string.
created_at: Automatically stores the timestamp when a record is created.
Unique Constraint on username:

Ensures that no two users can have the same username.
Notes
Replace the hashed password in the INSERT statement with the actual hash generated by your C++ code for testing.
Ensure that the MySQL service is running on localhost, and your root user has access with the specified password
